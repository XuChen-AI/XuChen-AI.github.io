## Abstract

This project develops high-precision, robust environmental perception algorithms for autonomous vehicles to enhance safety and reliability in complex driving scenarios. The system achieves 98.5% object detection accuracy with sub-50ms processing latency across diverse weather conditions.

## Methodology

**Multi-Sensor Data Fusion**: Advanced integration framework combining camera, LiDAR, and millimeter-wave radar data through spatiotemporal calibration and feature-level fusion techniques.

**Real-Time Deep Learning Pipeline**: Optimized CNN-based object detection and tracking algorithms with temporal consistency modeling for stable performance across consecutive frames.

**3D Point Cloud Processing**: Efficient segmentation and object recognition algorithms for LiDAR data with real-time performance requirements in autonomous driving scenarios.

**Robust Environmental Adaptation**: Weather-invariant perception algorithms tested across sunny, rainy, nighttime, and adverse conditions with comprehensive dataset validation covering 100,000+ annotated images.
Plans to further investigate dynamic scene understanding and behavior prediction capabilities to provide technical support for fully autonomous driving systems. Current research focuses on intention prediction and multi-agent interaction modeling.
