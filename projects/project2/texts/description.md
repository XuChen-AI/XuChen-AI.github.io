## Abstract

This project develops an intelligent personalized learning recommendation system using multi-modal behavior analysis and hybrid deep learning algorithms. The system achieves 40% improvement in learning efficiency and 92% user satisfaction through adaptive content delivery and real-time performance assessment.

## Methodology

**Multi-Modal Behavior Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis framework integrating learning duration, click patterns, assessment scores, and engagement metrics for holistic user profiling.

**Hybrid Recommendation Architecture**: Novel combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and attention-mechanism-based sequential models for personalized content delivery.

**Real-Time Adaptation Engine**: Dynamic recommendation strategy adjustment system using reinforcement learning principles to optimize learning outcomes based on continuous feedback.

**Knowledge Graph Integration**: Semantic relationship modeling between learning concepts to enable intelligent prerequisite tracking and adaptive difficulty progression.
